Scoots
================

Scoots is a very simple and lightweight **IRC link information bot** written in Ruby.

This bot is still in development. For use in your own IRC channel just change the server, channel, and port variables and run the script. Scoots also requires the 'mechanize' gem to function properly.

For Lincense information view the LICENSE file.
