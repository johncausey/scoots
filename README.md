## Scoots!

Scoots is a very simple and lightweight **IRC link information bot** written in Ruby.

This bot is still in development. Scoots requires the 'mechanize' gem to function properly.

For Lincense information view the LICENSE file.

Setup & Installation
================

You can use Scoots on your own IRC server or in your own IRC channel on another server.
        1. Edit the settings.yml file to fit your bot, server, and channel information.
        2. Run start_scoots.rb.
And that's pretty much it.
